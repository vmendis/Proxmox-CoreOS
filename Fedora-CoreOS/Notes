Configueration Files

Link to yaml file: https://github.com/vmendis/Proxmox-Fedora-CoreOS/blob/main/Fedora-CoreOS/bootstrap.yaml

This yaml file requires tranpiling to an Igntion config file.

Use this online service: https://techoverflow.net/2021/01/13/how-to-use-fcct-transpiler-online-without-installation/

I am using this ignition file which was created some time ago:
 https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vmendis/Proxmox-Fedora-CoreOS/main/Fedora-CoreOS/bootstrap.yaml


I have shortned the github url so I can type it easily on CoreOS
