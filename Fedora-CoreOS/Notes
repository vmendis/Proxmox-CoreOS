WIP Notes. These will be beautified later on

Assumptions:

a. It is expected user is aware of creating virtual machines (VM) in Proxmox.
b. Usage of secure shell (ssh)



Configueration Files

Link to yaml file: 
   https://github.com/vmendis/Proxmox-Fedora-CoreOS/blob/main/Fedora-CoreOS/bootstrap.yaml

This yaml file requires tranpiling to an Igntion config file. Use this online service:
    https://fcct.techoverflow.net/

I am using this ignition file which was created some time ago:
  https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vmendis/Proxmox-Fedora-CoreOS/main/Fedora-CoreOS/bootstrap.ign


I have shortned the github url so I can type it easily on CoreOS using free service:
   curl https://y.gy/4Vmj

Fedora CoreOS Setup:

Setup a VM on Proxmox for CoreOS
Boot from the CoreOS LiveCD
   -- Add image of console

cd /tmp
curl https://y.gy/4Vmj -L -o bootstrap.ign

view bootstrap.ign    // Sanity check the ignition file

lsblk -a

sudo coreos-installer install /dev/sda --ignition-file  bootstrap.ign

sudo init 6

Access newly created CoreOS using ssh
   $ ssh -i ~/.ssh/core_os_id_rsa core@192.168.1.50


A very advanced conigueration guide which includes modifying kernal parameters

Known Issues:

1. Warning about installing qemu agent

ssh -i ~/.ssh/core_os_id_rsa core@192.168.1.50
Fedora CoreOS 39.20240112.3.0
Tracker: https://github.com/coreos/fedora-coreos-tracker
Discuss: https://discussion.fedoraproject.org/tag/coreos

[systemd]
Failed Units: 1
  install-qemu-agent.service

When connecting to the FCOS serever using ssh, message about the failed unit is displayed.
However, the qemu agent has been installed and running. This can be seen on Proxmox as the
IP number of the FCOS is listed.


$ ps -aef|grep agent
root         933       1  0 03:42 ?        00:00:00 /usr/bin/qemu-ga --method=virtio-serial --path=/dev/virtio-ports/org.qemu.guest_agent.0 --blacklist= -F/etc/qemu-ga/fsfreeze-hook

Will try to fix this sometime as the functioanlity is not broken.
