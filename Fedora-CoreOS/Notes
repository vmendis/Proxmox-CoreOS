WIP Notes. These will be beautified later on

Assumptions:

a. It is expected user is aware of creating virtual machines (VM) in Proxmox.
b. Usage of secure shell (ssh)



Configueration Files

Link to yaml file: 
   https://github.com/vmendis/Proxmox-Fedora-CoreOS/blob/main/Fedora-CoreOS/bootstrap.yaml

This yaml file requires tranpiling to an Igntion config file. Use this online service:
    https://fcct.techoverflow.net/

I am using this ignition file which was created some time ago:
  https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vmendis/Proxmox-Fedora-CoreOS/main/Fedora-CoreOS/bootstrap.ign


I have shortned the github url so I can type it easily on CoreOS using free service:
   curl https://y.gy/4Vmj

Fedora CoreOS Setup:

Setup a VM on Proxmox for CoreOS
Boot from the CoreOS LiveCD
   -- Add image of console

cd /tmp
curl https://y.gy/4Vmj -L -o bootstrap.ign

view bootstrap.ign    // Sanity check the ignition file

sudo coreos-installer install /dev/sda --ignition-file  bootstrap.ign

sudo init 6

Access newly created CoreOS using ssh
   $ ssh -i ~/.ssh/core_os_id_rsa core@192.168.1.50
